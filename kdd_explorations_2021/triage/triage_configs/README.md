###### Triage experiment config
Triage configs used for running the original triage experiments.
Sample configs can be seen even on Triage's original repository.

Things to keep in mind:

1. Run the original triage first that is without any sampling. Generally with `replace=True`
1. For sampled matrices, run with `replace=False`, and make sure that the triage directory is same as the directory of where all the sampled matrices reside.
